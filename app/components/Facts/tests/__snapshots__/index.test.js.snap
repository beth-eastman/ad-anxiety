Anxiety can become so severe that it prevents a person from leaving his or her home. Severe anxiety can prevent a person from going to work or engaging in meaningful activities with friends and family.

        </h2>
        Those with anxiety disorders often avoid engaging with others because of fear of embarrassing themselves. This can put a strain on significant others and on children. Those with the anxiety disorders may want to be alone and may not want to engage in activities outside the house with family members and friends. In addition to avoiding others, those with anxiety often avoid stressful situations or public places. This avoidance can greatly inhibit daily activities for the family members and reduce the number and quality of interactions with family and friends.

          What to do if a Family Member Has Anxiety Problems
        </h2>
        Engage in empathy: Try to see the world through the eyes of the anxious family member. The world likely seems like a scary place for them. Understanding his or her feelings and thoughts can increase the understanding of what they are going through. Gather information: Take time to learn about the family member’s condition. Talk to them and read about the condition and its treatment. Get involved: Encourage the family member to get help. Attending counseling and doctor’s appointments with the family member can show support and can also provide information about the anxiety condition and ways to improve it. Anxious individuals can experience difficulties concentrating and responding to multiple sources of information. A family member can listen to information that an anxious individual might not be able to hear.
