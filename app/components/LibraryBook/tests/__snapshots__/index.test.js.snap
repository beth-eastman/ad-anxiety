Anxiety can be a normal reaction to new and positive challenges or to stressful events.  But, anxiety can also be the result of distorted thinking and other controllable causes; if not  controlled, anxiety  can become problematic and  interfere with  your health and wellness.<br><h2>1.1 - What is Anxiety?</h2>Anxiety is a mix of thoughts, emotions and physical reactions.  People describe experiencing “butterflies” or “knots” in their bellies, or a pounding heart, or chest tightness. Anxiety can be useful, signaling the body to go “on alert” and prepare for action.  Anxiety can be a motivator or a response to the anticipation of an event.  Anxiety can signal a person to act, which can facilitate coping with a difficult situation.<br><h2>1.2 - What is Worry?</h2>Worry is the thinking part of anxiety in which the worrier regularly predicts the occurrence of negative or catastrophic events in his life or in the life of loved ones. Worried thinking often leads anxiety’s physical symptoms (rapid heartbeat, restlessness, disrupted sleep, etc.).<br><br>Everyone worries about something at one time or another. But, worry becomes problematic when it is chronic and interferes with daily living.  It becomes a cycle that is difficult to break and may cause you to make significant lifestyle changes like isolating yourself or avoiding public places.  Worried thinking focuses on the likelihood of negative outcomes without realistic efforts to plan or problem solve.  Worry is about living in the future by always thinking “What if?”<br><br>Here are some signs that worry might be problematic in your life:<ul><li>You are chronically on alert and thinking about potential future dangers or threats</li><li>You are consistently making negative predictions about the future</li><li>You tend to overestimate the likelihood that something bad will happen</li><li>You repeat worried thoughts over and over again in your head</li></ul><br><br><b>Here is an example of worry leading to anxiety:</b><br><br><i>Jim hopes to be promoted at his job.  He has been in the same position for five years and has been working hard.  He was deployed for 12 months and has returned to work.  Since returning from deployment, he has received consistently positive feedback and yearly reviews from his employer.  Jim passed the preliminary review for the promotion, and has a formal, in-person interview coming up.  Jim is worried (predicting) that he will not get the job, even though he believes that he is the most qualified candidate for the position.  Jim thinks he will be too anxious to accurately answer the interviewer’s questions, even though he has been preparing himself for two weeks.  He finds himself wondering: “What if my mind goes blank? What if they view my deployment negatively? What if the roads are icy and I can’t get to the interview on time? What if I spill coffee on myself the morning before the interview?” Every time he thinks (worries) about the interview his heart races, his palms sweat and he has butterflies (anxiety).</i><br><br>This example shows how worried thinking can lead to anxiety. Even though Jim is qualified for the position and has been preparing for the interview, he has been focusing most of his attention on the future (e.g. “What if?”) and the catastrophic outcomes to follow.  He has not engaged in any planning or problem solving.<br><br><b>Another example:</b><br><br><i>Steve is scheduled to compete in a national karate competition in two weeks.  His military training has mentally prepared him, and the required PT has kept him in shape. He has practiced.  His friends and family will be traveling from around the country to watch him compete.  He doesn’t want to let them, his coach or himself down.  His motivation and excitement cause him to practice more frequently and review videos from previous competitions to gain new insight and improve his techniques.</i><br><br>This example shows how worry can be constructive. Steve’s thinking does not involve predicting catastrophic outcomes.  Rather, he interprets his body’s arousal as motivation and excitement, leading him toward planning and problem solving strategies. These include continued practice and review of his previous competitions to improve his technique.<br><br>",
